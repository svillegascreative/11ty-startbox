# Start Box
My opinionated starting point for static sites created with [Eleventy](11ty.io). This repository is a template, which means it can be used to generate new repos as a launching pad for new Eleventy projects, based on all the things I'd want to put in there anyway.


## Site Meta Data
Update the site metadata in `/src/_data/meta.json` with the new site details. These details will go in the `<head>` of all the pages, except where page-specific data exists.
